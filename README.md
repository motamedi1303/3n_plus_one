# 3n_plus_one
The 3n + 1 problem

Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain class of problems (e.g.,
NP, Unsolvable, Recursive). In this problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose
classification is not known for all possible inputs.

Consider the following algorithm:
1. input n
2. print n
3. if n = 1 then STOP
4. if n is odd then n  = 3n + 1
5. else n  = n/2
6. GOTO 2

Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed
22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
